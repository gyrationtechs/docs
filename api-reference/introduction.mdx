## Welcome

Welcome to the SendLayer API documentation. For a quick introduction to sending emails, see our guide to [getting started with the SendLayer API](https://sendlayer.com/docs/getting-started-with-the-sendlayer-api/).

## Base URL

SendLayer's API follows **REST** principles. All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://console.sendlayer.com/api/v1/
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate, you'll need to add an **Authorization** header with the content of the header being `Bearer <token>`, where token is your SendLayer API key.

To learn how to access your SendLayer API key, check out our tutorial on [managing API keys](https://sendlayer.com/docs/managing-api-keys/).

```
Authorization: 'Bearer <token>'
```
